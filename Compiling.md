# Introduction #

You have a few requirements before getting started. It's not that hard to compile vortex though, just a bit boring.

# Commands to compile #
  * apt-get install mercurial cmake
  * hg clone https://code.google.com/p/quake-2-vortex/
  * cmake .
  * make

# what's next #

Copy your newly compiled shared library on your regular friendly vortex folder.
For instance, if you have your Quake 2 server installation in /home/joe/quake2
you should proceed and create /home/joe/quake2/vortex/yournewlycompiledbinaryhere

Run a server as any quake 2 server is ran.
