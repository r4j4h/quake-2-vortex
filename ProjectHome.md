It's been years. Years since the mod first came into being.

While the story right now is missing, it's short on saying something like, "The source wasn't ever released". But now we got the hold of it. And we're freeing it. Hopefully bringing new life and further development of one of the most complex mods of Quake 2.

The main branch should be the code for the Vortex version 4.63. Grab it with mercurial.
